I don’t like to get bogged down with much gear.  The DP and I discuss lighting and camera packages ahead of shoots so that we only bring what we need.

I like the cinematic quality of the Arri Alexa, which emulates 35mm, to establish the look of the film.  For B-cameras I use the Canon C300mkII and a Sony a7sII.  Both are versatile “work horse” cameras that allow the operator to quickly swap lenses and quickly move between composed shots to free form/hand-held scenarios. The a7sII is especially great for shooting specialty shots where bigger cameras cannot fit. It is great for low-light conditions and off-speed instances. Small and unobtrusive, it allows our subjects to really open up. I used a combination of all three in past films and they blend seamlessly in post-production.
